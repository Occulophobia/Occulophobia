I plan to use my GitHub as a personal archive of my coding work and practice. Like a portfolio but not everything has to be perfect. This is mostly so I can track my progress and growth as I learn more about development! :D 

If you wanna know more about me, check out my [rentry](https://rentry.org/visophobia)!

### I'm currently studying to be a software dev! 

The languages I know how to use are:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Python
- some TI-Basic

And I'm currently learning:
- C#

I aspire to be an indie game dev someday! :>

I really like to draw! I will have an art gallery done on my [Neocities](https://occulophobia.neocities.org) when I finish it! (still very much under construction.... sorry..)
I also enjoy coding and playing videogames :> my current favourites are Muse Dash, D4DJ, and most of the Touhou games (my favourite is TH11 hehe...)

Other things i enjoy talking about are languages, history, science (especially chemistry and biology), animanga, ~~yuri~~, and animals! my fav animals are cephalopods!!
